# Cloud Storage System

A cloud-based system that allows users to store their files on the cloud.
This project is only meant as an assignment.


## The problem

With normal physical storage:

- people can't access their files from wherever they are
- people have limited space for their files
- people constantly risk losing their files in case their storage device fails

This software solves these problems by moving the storage to the cloud and allowing users to safely access their data from the web.


## Requirements

The system must allow users to:

- create an account with a custom nickname and profile picture
- view, upload, download and delete files and folders
- share their files and folders with other users
- view "last modified time" and owner of each file and folder
- pay for additional storage space
